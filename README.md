# JDSA_final_task
A short data science project about analyzing datas from a fictional travel blog. 

This was the final task of Tomi Mester's course, Junior Data Scientist Academy in 2023. It involves analyzing logs from a fictional travel blog and developing recommendations from the data for how the business owner strategically expand his investment of time and money in the business. 

My approach was to use BASH to get and clean datas. Use SQL for simpler analyses (queries to make trend and distribution charts; segmentation analyses; funnel analysis). Use Python Jupiter Notebook for compley analyses (cohort analyses, polinomial regression for num_readers prediction, random forest for purchases prediction).
